# ZX-81-ROMS

Study of the Sinclair ZX-81 ROMS disassembly.

There are a lot of resources in the internet with scattered information about the internal workings of the
Sinclair ZX-81 operating system that came in a 8K ROM.

This project builds on these resources by add information and keeping this open for comments and discussion.

As far as I know, the Sinclair ROM copyright is held by Amstrad, who has allowed non-commercial use of its contents. 
This project is setup on this princile. If I'm wrong, and this project infringes any copyright rights, please
