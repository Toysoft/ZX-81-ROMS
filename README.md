# ZX-81-ROMS

Study of the Sinclair ZX-81 ROMS disassembly.

There are a lot of resources in the internet with scattered information about the internal workings of the
Sinclair ZX-81 operating system that came in a 8K ROM.

This project builds on these resources by add information and keeping this open for comments and discussion.

As far as I know, the Sinclair ROM copyright is held by Amstrad, who has allowed non-commercial use of its contents. 
This project is setup on this princile. If I'm wrong, and this project infringes any copyright rights, please
let me know.

The assembly source files are in the syntax used by the Z88DK Z80ASM assembler [https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk "The development kit for over fifty z80 machines - c compiler, assembler, linker, libraries").
